## Blockchain: Ethereum

Small example to test Ethereum infrastructure with:

1) Connect to blockchain (local test with Gache).
2) Write a contract with SOLIDITY
3) Push contract to blockchain
4) Update contract with new data

### Setup

Run ```./node_modules/.bin/ganache-cli``` 

Late run ```node index.js```

Happy coding!
